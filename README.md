# Generating Monet painting with GAN

The primary objective of this project is to create paintings that emulate the iconic style of Claude Monet using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). This innovative approach leverages the power of neural networks to produce unique artistic interpretations reminiscent of Monet’s masterpieces.

At the core of a DCGAN are two distinct neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator is tasked with creating new images, while the discriminator's role is to differentiate between the generated images and authentic works of art. Through a competitive training process, these two networks refine their abilities; the generator learns to produce increasingly convincing images, while the discriminator improves its capacity to identify fakes. This adversarial relationship fosters an environment in which the generator strives to mimic the stylistic nuances of the input images as closely as possible.

For this project, I have curated a dataset comprising 300 paintings by Monet, each resized to a resolution of 256x256 pixels. This dataset was sourced from the Kaggle competition titled "I’m Something of a Painter Myself". By utilizing this dataset, I aim to train the DCGAN effectively, enabling it to learn the intricate patterns, color palettes, and brushstroke techniques that define Monet’s work.
